# indie-author-assignement
Indie assignement for school due the second of June. A site for author and economic journalist Ole Hall.

### Purpose
The website's purpose is to deliver information about Ole, his books and his other projects as a journalist, along with links for buying / reading / listening to these. As Ole has many different projects it's important to introduce all of the projects as one might search for one project without knowing the others exist. It will also be a place to contact Ole about talks or interviews.


#### How
There will be several links throughtout the pages to the same project, but the links will have different looks. For example there will be links in the header called by it's project name, but as one might not know what it is, it will also be introduced below in a card and a picture. If the visiters purpose on the website is to read more about Ole, there will also be a short text below the cards about him that takes you to his about page.
